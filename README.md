# Unsupervised_Learning_Final_Project

CU Boulder Unsupervised Learning Final Project

This repository contains the jupyter notebook used to generate the pdf submitted for the unsupervised learning final project.

If you want to try running the code yourself, keep in mind that it may take quite a while (15 minutes or more) for some cells if you are not using a work station.

If any of the SVD or PCA cells take more than 2 minutes to run, the model is failing to converge and the notebook needs to be restarted. This is rare for n_components below 300, but becomes more likely the higher the number of components.
